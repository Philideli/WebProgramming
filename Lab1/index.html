                printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived

                unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
                Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
                including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
